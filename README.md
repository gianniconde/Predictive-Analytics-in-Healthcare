## About the Project
The goal of this project is to examine the event of death due to heart failure based on various clinical measurements. The methods utilized for this analysis are supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The supervised machine learning algoritms include random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The unsupervised machine learning algorithm used is association rule mining where we utilized the apriori algorithm. <br>
